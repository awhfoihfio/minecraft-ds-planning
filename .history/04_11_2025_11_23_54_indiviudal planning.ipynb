    "\n",
    "For this project, I will build a predictive model to determine whether a player will subscribe to the research newsletter based on their gameplay behaviour and demographics.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I will use `played_hours`, `experience`, and `Age` as predictors. Before modeling, I will check for skewed variables and consider transformations if necessary (e.g., log‐transforming heavily skewed play‐time values). I will also check for missing values and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be split into **training and testing sets (80/20)** to evaluate the model’s performance. Model accuracy and confusion matrix will be used as evaluation metrics.\n",
